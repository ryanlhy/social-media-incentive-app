# EngageReward - Solana Social Incentive Platform for Low-Cap Community Builders

## Core Concept
A **Solana-based platform** specifically designed for **low-cap coin projects and early-stage startups** building communities, where **founders and community leaders** fund campaigns to incentivize authentic social media engagement, with **automatic USDC payments** to verified participants through an **invitation-only system**.

- Set campaign parameters: duration, budget, eligibility criteria for community members
- **Create Raid Campaigns**: Set up time-limited engagement campaigns (e.g., 24 hours) for specific X posts
- Define reward amounts per interaction (e.g., $0.01 USDC per like, $0.05 per comment)
- Choose reward type: USDC only, project token only, or both (e.g., 1 cent worth of token)
- Enable referral system allowing participants to invite up to 10 friends each to grow the community
