# MVP Goals & Strategy

## üéØ Primary Goal

**Validate market demand**: Prove that low-cap founders are willing to pay USDC for measurable, authentic engagement and that participants actually show up and engage when rewards are automated.

## üõ† MVP Core Features (Minimum Viable)

### Campaign Creation (Founder Side)
- **Input Requirements**: 
  - Campaign budget (in USDC)
  - Task type (tweet, retweet, twitter likes, comment)
- **Fund Management**: Lock funds in campaign wallet (custodial for speed)

### Participation (User Side)
- **Access Model**: Invitation-only approach
- **Target**: Manually onboard 50‚Äì100 trusted testers
  - Crypto Twitter friends
  - Telegram hustlers

### Verification & Payout
- **Verification**: Twitter api verification
- **Payout**: Auto-payout in USDC on Solana
  - One-click "send from treasury wallet"
  - No full smart contract automation needed at MVP stage

### Basic Dashboard
- **Founder View**:
  - Budget spent tracking
  - Number of tasks completed
  - Engagement metrics with links to actual posts
- **Participant View**:
  - Tasks completed history
  - USDC earned tracking

## ‚è≥ Development Timeline

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- Create landing page explaining value proposition
- Collect interest from potential founders

### Week 3-4: Core Development
- Build simple web application (Next.js + Solana wallet integration)
- Implement basic campaign and participation features

### Month 2: Validation
- Run 2-3 real paid campaigns with test projects
- Gather feedback and metrics

## üîë Key Validation Metrics

### Market Demand
- **Question**: Will founders actually put $100‚Äì$500 into a campaign?
- **Success Metric**: 3-5 funded campaigns with satisfied founders

### User Engagement
- **Question**: Can you get real users (not bots) to perform tasks for $1‚Äì$5 payouts?
- **Success Metric**: Consistent participation from invited testers

### Value Delivery
- **Question**: Is the engagement worth it for founders?
- **Measurement**: Trackable clicks, followers, conversions

### Decision Framework
- **If successful** ‚Üí Validated concept, proceed to Phase 2
- **If unsuccessful** ‚Üí Pivot considerations:
  - Token payouts instead of USDC
  - Focus on fraud-proof verification
  - Adjust reward amounts or task types

## üöÄ Phase 2 Roadmap (Post-MVP Success)

### Technical Evolution
- Smart contract automation (escrow + auto release)
- On-chain reputation system for participants
- AI-based social verification for bot detection

### Business Evolution
- Expand to self-service campaigns
- Reduce manual hand-holding
- Scale participant base

## üí° Key Principles

### Avoid Over-Engineering
- Don't spend 6 months coding complex on-chain systems
- Prove demand with semi-manual processes first
- Build only what's necessary to validate core assumptions

### Focus on Validation
- Prioritize learning over features
- Get real money commitments from founders
- Measure actual engagement outcomes

### Iterative Approach
- Start with trusted network
- Gather feedback continuously
- Pivot quickly based on data

## üéØ How This Could Succeed

### 1. Laser Focus on Verification Technology
- **Core Differentiator**: Prove that participants aren't just bots farming rewards
- **Competitive Moat**: Superior anti-bot detection and authentic engagement verification
- **Implementation**: Start with manual verification, evolve to automated systems

### 2. Concrete Case Studies with Micro-Projects
- **Target**: Get 2-3 early projects with measurable results
- **Example Success Story**: "$200 campaign brought 500 genuine followers with measurable conversions"
- **Documentation**: Create detailed case studies showing ROI and engagement quality
- **Social Proof**: Use results to attract more founders

### 3. Full Transparency Through Metrics
- **Dashboard Focus**: Show users exactly what they're getting for their spend
- **Key Metrics Display**:
  - Engagement quality scores
  - Conversion tracking
  - Participant authenticity ratings
  - Cost per genuine interaction
- **Real-time Updates**: Live campaign performance monitoring

### 4. Community-First Approach
- **Ambassador Program**: Onboard communities through trusted ambassadors
- **Invite-Only Value**: Make exclusivity part of the value proposition
- **Quality Curation**: Position as "curated, high-quality contributors only"
- **Network Effects**: Leverage existing crypto communities and relationships

## Success Criteria

**MVP is successful if**: 3-5 campaigns are funded in USDC with happy founders providing positive feedback and measurable engagement results.

This validation proves the core value proposition and justifies investment in Phase 2 automation and scaling features.
